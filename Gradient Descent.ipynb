    "Gradient Descent is a very generic optimization algorithm capable of finding optimal solutions to a wide range of problems. The general idea of Gradient Descent is to tweak paramenters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function.\n",

    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Mini-batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent does : it measures teh local gradient of the error function with regards to the parameter vector $\\theta$, and it goes in the direction of descending gradient. Once the gradient is zero, you have reached a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by filling $\\theta$ with random values(random initialization) and then improve it gradually, taking one baby step at a time, each step attempting to decrease teh cost function until the algorithm converges to a minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important paprameter in Gradient Descent is the size of the steps, determined by the learning rate hyperparameter. If the learning rate is \n"
