    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is also called as Logi Regression. It is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instace belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "If the estimated probability is greater than 50% then the model predicts that the instance belongs to the class or else it predicts that it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression model computes a weighted sum of the input features but instead of outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it outputs the logistic of this result\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{p} = h_{\\theta}(x) = \\sigma(\\theta^T . X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(.)$ is a signoid function that outputs a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Logistic Regression model has estimated the probability   $\\dot{p} = h_{\\theta}(x)$  that an instance x belongs to the positive class, it can make its prediction $\\dot{y}$ easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{y}$ = 0 if p < 0.5, <br>\n",
    "$\\dot{y}$ = 1 if p > 0.5,\n",
